# Thaumic-Wands-Remastered
 Wands for Thaumcraft 6 (Now remastered).

 The main goal with this remaster is just to fix a memory leak that was happening on the original mod and also to fix the size of the wands, which used to be stupidly big.

 There's no plans for updating it in the future and I'm sure If I will ever be able to add new functionalitis to it.
 But you can always send you crashlogs and pull requests if you want to. (Mainly the pull requests, but...) I will take a look in to them and I'll try my best to add them to the mod.
