Things to fix

* Fix research types not showing their icons properly and not being recognized by the code. Thaumic Bases Unofficial and Thaumic Additions: Reconstructed researches are being affected aswell. Weirdly enough, if Thaumic Arcana is present, its curiosities have a chance to give you those points, but as a "different category" unnamed with no icon just setted as "Theory". But even so, that curios cannot be obtained besides cheating (yet);

* Fix Wands don't casting any spells when you're aiming to any block;

* Fix Thauminite Caps recipe's bug (Thauminite is a material added by Thaumic Bases Unofficial);

* Make Thaumaturgy and Fundamentals tabs not bug when the command "/thaumcraft reload" is used;

* Fix an issue with Arcane Workbench if Rustic Thaumaturgy is present when if you try to craft Primal Charm, the game identifies the recipe for Crystal Brass Sconces and doesn't let you craft the charm, unless BOTH brass ingots aren't the Alchemical ones from Thaumcraft (example: Brass Ingots from TechReborn). For this, mods like "NoMoreRecipeConflict" or "Yet Another Recipe Conflict Fixer (YARCF)" don't help because they don't work on Arcane Workbench (yet);

* Rework code;
